		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p id="about-me">I am pursuing the Web Technologies professional graduate certificate through the Harvard Extension School, with the aim of becoming a web developer with a focus on front end development. I am currently the webmaster for the Boston Whovians, a local Doctor Who fangroup, and I run my own online store where I sell handmade crocheted goods. I also have two cats, both of below average intelligence and one with notable sleep apnea. I am taking this course to deepen my understanding of web development, which has been largely front-end focused so far. I have taken courses in HTML and CSS, as well as in C++ and Python. For as long as my current abused laptop holds out, I am using a PC running Windows 7. My preferred prounouns are "they/them".</p>
